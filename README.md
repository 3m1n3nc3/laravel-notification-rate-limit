Rate Limiting Notifications in Laravel using Laravel's native rate limiter to avoid flooding users with duplicate notifications.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jamesmills/laravel-notification-rate-limit
```

### Update your Notifications
    
Add `ShouldRateLimit` and `RateLimitedNotification` to your the Notifications you would like to Raterate limit.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Notifications;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use Jamesmills\LaravelNotificationRateLimit\RateLimitedNotification;
use Jamesmills\LaravelNotificationRateLimit\ShouldRateLimit;

class NotifyUserOfOrderUpdateNotification extends Notification implements ShouldRateLimit
{
    use Queueable;
    use RateLimitedNotification;

...
```

## Publish Config
    
Everything in this package has opinionated global defaults. However, you can override everything in the config. 
    
Publish it using the command below.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jamesmills\LaravelNotificationRateLimit\LaravelNotificationRateLimitServiceProvider"
```
    
## Options
    
You can custom settings on an individual Notification level.
    
### Events

By default the `NotificationRateLimitReached` event will be fired when a Notification is skipped. You can customise this using the `event` option in the config.

### Overding the time the notification is rate limited for 

By default an throttled Notification will be throttled for `60` seconds. 
    
Update globally with the `rate_limit_seconds` config setting.

Update for an individual basis by adding the below to the Notification
    
``` php
// Change rate limit to 1 hour
protected $rateLimitForSeconds = 3600;
```
    
### Logging skipped notifications

By default this package will log all skipped notifications.
    
Update globally with the `log_skipped_notifications` config setting.
    
Update for an individual basis by adding the below to the Notification
    
```php
// Do not log skipped notifications
protected $logSkippedNotifications = false;
```
    
### Skipping uniqueue notifications

By default the Rate Limiter uses a cache key made up of some opinionated defaults. One of these default keys is `serialize($notification)`. You may wish to turn this off. 

Update globally with the `should_rate_limit_unique_notifications` config setting.

Update for an individual basis by adding the below to the Notification
    
```php
// Do not log skipped notifications
protected $shouldRateLimitUniqueNotifications = false;
```

### Customising the cache key

You may want to customise the parts used in the cache key. You can do this by adding the below to your Notification.

```php
public function rateLimitCustomCacheKeyParts()
{
    return [
        $this->account_id
    ];
}
```
